# Data Science Final Project
In order to create a good book recommendation system, one must acquire the dataset and be able to use machine learning tools to provide accurate predictions. However, with the vast selection of machine learning techniques available, may it be supervised or unsupervised learning, accuracy comparison testing must be done to find the best and least favorable technique to implement for the dataset. With that, this research is conducted to find the most and least applicable machine learning technique for our organically scraped dataset. This dataset is collected and cleaned from the Goodreads dataset. Containing the title, author, author average rating, author votes, review count, distinct works, year, rating, raters, and genres.

### Testing History 
Here is the testing spreadsheet containing all the test scrapes we have done. However to note, these sheets are no longer used for our research. Instead they are our testing logs and documentation for us to fully grasp scraping, munging, and dataset preprocessing.
